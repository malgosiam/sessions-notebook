Shell and Terminal
You are probably used to using GUIs (Graphical User Interfaces) to interact with computers.

Often times developers interact with computers using CLIs (Command Line Interfaces) which are text based user interfaces. That means that you type commands to interact with the computer (create / move / delete / edit files, install software, change system settings...).

This has the following reasons / advantages:

Many tools don't have a GUI and can only be used as a CLI.
You can write scripts (which consist of a number of commands) to automate processes and repetitive tasks and ensure they are being run exactly the same way every time they are executed.
